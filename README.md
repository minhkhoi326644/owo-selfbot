Method 2: Press **Ctrl + Shift + I** and paste the following function.

```javascript
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
  [Math.random()],
  {},
  (req) => {
    if (!req.c) return;
    for (const m of Object.keys(req.c)
      .map((x) => req.c[x].exports)
      .filter((x) => x)) {
      if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {
        return copy(m.default.getToken());
      }
      if (m.getToken !== undefined) {
        return copy(m.getToken());
      }
    }
  },
]);
console.log("%cWorked!", "font-size: 50px");
console.log(`%cYou now have your token in the clipboard!`, "font-size: 16px");
